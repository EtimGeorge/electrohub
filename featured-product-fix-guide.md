# Fix for Non-Rendering Featured Products Section

## Problem
The "Featured Products" section in `home.html` is not appearing on the page, while the other sections (Hero, Featured Departments, Our Services) are rendering correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue stems from invalid HTML in the `home.html` file within the `.featured-products-section`. Each product card was wrapped in a single anchor tag (`<a>`), which also contained other interactive elements like `<button>`. This structure is problematic for two main reasons:

1.  **Unclosed Tags:** The wrapping `<a>` tags for each product card were not properly closed. This is a significant HTML syntax error that confuses the browser's parser, often causing it to stop rendering the rest of the content in that section.
2.  **Nesting Interactive Elements:** Nesting interactive elements like `<button>` inside an anchor tag (`<a>`) is not valid HTML and leads to unpredictable behavior across different browsers. An anchor tag is meant for navigation, while a button is meant to trigger an action.

## Solution
The fix is to restructure the HTML for each product card to be valid. Instead of wrapping the entire card in an anchor tag, we will make only the non-interactive elements (like the image and title) the actual links. The buttons will remain as separate interactive elements.

### Steps to Fix `home.html`:

1.  Open the `home.html` file.
2.  Locate the `<section class="featured-products-section">`.
3.  For each of the four product cards inside the `<div class="products-grid">`, replace the existing card structure with the corrected version below.

### Example of a Corrected Product Card:

Replace this **incorrect** structure:

```html
<!-- INCORRECT STRUCTURE -->
<a href="#product-led-bulb" class="product-card">
  <div class="product-card-image-wrapper">
    <img src="..." alt="A bright, energy-efficient LED bulb">
  </div>
  <div class="product-card-content">
    <h3 class="product-card-title">Energy-Efficient LED Bulbs</h3>
    <p class="product-card-description">Illuminate your space while saving on energy costs...</p>
  </div>
  <div class="product-card-actions">
    <button class="btn btn-secondary quick-view-btn">Quick View</button>
    <button class="btn btn-primary add-to-cart-btn">Add to Cart</button>
  </div>
</a>
```

With this **correct** structure:

```html
<!-- CORRECTED STRUCTURE -->
<div class="product-card">
  <a href="#product-led-bulb" class="product-card-image-link">
    <div class="product-card-image-wrapper">
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595169477343-671e252a6b28?q=80&w=1974&auto=format&fit=crop" alt="A bright, energy-efficient LED bulb">
    </div>
  </a>
  <div class="product-card-content">
    <h3 class="product-card-title">
      <a href="#product-led-bulb">Energy-Efficient LED Bulbs</a>
    </h3>
    <p class="product-card-description">Illuminate your space while saving on energy costs with our wide range of LED lighting solutions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="product-card-actions">
    <button class="btn btn-secondary quick-view-btn" data-product-id="prod123">Quick View</button>
    <button class="btn btn-primary add-to-cart-btn">Add to Cart</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

By applying this corrected structure to all product cards within the "Featured Products" section, the HTML will be valid, and the section will render as expected.
