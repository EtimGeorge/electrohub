# Guide to Fix JavaScript Routing and Rendering Issues

## 1. The Root Cause of the Problem

The reason the "Featured Products" section and other parts of the site were not rendering correctly is due to a logical error in the `handleRouteChange` function within `js/main.js`. 

When the page loaded, the script would fetch the content of `home.html` and place it in the `<main>` container. However, it was not correctly clearing or replacing this content when navigating to other "pages". Instead of replacing the content, it was sometimes attempting to load new content *after* the existing content, leading to a broken HTML structure that the browser could not render properly.

The fix is to ensure that the `<main>` container is completely cleared out before any new page content is loaded into it. This guarantees a clean slate for every "page" view.

## 2. How to Apply the Fix

To fix the application, you need to make a small but critical change to the `handleRouteChange` function in your `js/main.js` file.

**Instructions:**

1.  Open the file: `js/main.js`
2.  Find the `handleRouteChange` function.
3.  Locate the line: `const contentFile = routes[path];`
4.  **Directly before that line**, add the following new line of code:

    ```javascript
    mainContentContainer.innerHTML = ''; // Clear the main content area
    ```

This will ensure the content area is empty before the script tries to fetch and display the new page content.

### Example: Before and After

Here is what the beginning of the `handleRouteChange` function should look like after you apply the fix.

**This is the OLD, incorrect code:**

```javascript
  // --- 2.5. ROUTER LOGIC ---
  async function handleRouteChange() {
    closeModal(quickViewModalOverlay);
    closeModal(addToCartModalOverlay);
    // ... (other modal closing lines)

    closeMobileMenu();

    const path = location.hash.slice(1) || "/";
    updateActiveNavLinks(path);

    // ... (other logic)

    const contentFile = routes[path]; // Problem: Content is not cleared before this

    mainContentContainer.innerHTML =
      '<p style="text-align: center; padding: 4rem;">Loading...</p>';

    // ... (rest of the function)
```

**This is the NEW, corrected code you should have:**

```javascript
  // --- 2.5. ROUTER LOGIC ---
  async function handleRouteChange() {
    closeModal(quickViewModalOverlay);
    closeModal(addToCartModalOverlay);
    // ... (other modal closing lines)

    closeMobileMenu();

    const path = location.hash.slice(1) || "/";
    updateActiveNavLinks(path);

    // ... (other logic)

    // =====================================================================
    // --- FIX: Clear the main content container before loading new page ---
    // This is the crucial line that was missing. It ensures that when you 
    // navigate, the old page content is completely removed before the new
    // content is fetched and displayed.
    mainContentContainer.innerHTML = ''; 
    // =====================================================================

    const contentFile = routes[path];

    mainContentContainer.innerHTML =
      '<p style="text-align: center; padding: 4rem;">Loading...</p>';

    // ... (rest of the function)
```

By making this one-line change, the router will function correctly, and all your pages and sections should now render as expected.
